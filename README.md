# Components

## Goals

1. To have a set of standalone, reusable UI components
2. Which can be rendered into a static website
3. And can be understood easily by other designers and developers

### Standalone

Every component must contain its own `data`, `structure`, `style` and `behavior`.

### Reusable

Components can freely include other components and can be bundled together to form user interfaces of any complexity

### Rendering

1. The components should be able to be rendered individually, ie. they must act like a complete styleguide entry
2. A collection of components should be able to be rendered into a webpage

### Understandability

Naming components and locating them in the source code should follow a rule everybody can easily understand and learn in a day
