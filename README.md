# Components

## Goals

1. To have a set of standalone, reusable UI components
2. Which can be rendered into a static website
3. And can be understood easily by other designers and developers
4. Also creating components should be easy
5. And the generated production code should be world class

### Standalone

Every component must contain its own `data`, `structure`, `style` and `behavior`.

### Reusable

Components can freely include other components and can be bundled together to form user interfaces of any complexity

### Rendering

1. The components should be able to be rendered individually, ie. they must act like a complete styleguide entry
2. A collection of components should be able to be rendered into a webpage

### Understandability

1. Naming components and locating them in the source code should follow a rule everybody can easily understand and learn in a day
2. There should be a live documentation for all components, made both for designers and developers

### Automation

1. There should be scripts generating component skeletons, component collections, and merging them into webpages
2. Designers and developers should focus only on creating things not on the underlying infrastructure

### Best practices

1. Both source code and the generated final website should incorporate industry best practices
