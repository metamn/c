// Fixed scroll
//
// Displays a set of sections where the section title is fixed and it's content scrolls normally
// Uses '_.throttle' from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs#throttle).
// Based on an idea from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)
//
// $title-width - the width of the fixed part
//
// How it works:
// - all fixed parts has `position: absolute`, the current visible part has `position: fixed`
// - since we use `fixed` we can't use flexbox just the plain old positioning
// - since we use `fixed` this technique must be used as a layout, ie, can't have anything above and/or below like other sections
//

@mixin fixed-scroll($title-width: 10%) {
  position: relative;

  &__slide {
    @include fixed-scroll__slide($title-width);
