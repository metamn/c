// Fixed scroll
//
// Displays a set of sections where the section title is fixed and it's content scrolls normally
// Uses '_.throttle' from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs#throttle).
// Based on an idea from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)
//
// $title-width - the width of the fixed part
//
// How it works:
// - all fixed parts has `position: absolute`, the current visible part has `position: fixed`
// - since we use `fixed` we can't use flexbox just the plain old positioning.
// - This is no problem since both the fixed part and content part can use flexbox internally
// - since we use `fixed` this technique must be used as a layout, ie, can't have anything above and/or below like other sections
// - if we put placeholders above and below, a new function has to be added which checks if the `position` has to be switched or not.
// - ie. the slides container is in the viewport or not
//
