// Link
//
// Basic Link styling. It deals only with colors. Decorations are handled separately.
// Basic link styling is not trivial but [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/v/visited/) has a good overview.
//
// $color-scheme - The background and foreground colors
// $color-scheme-hover - The background and foreground colors on hover
// $color-scheme-visited - The background and foreground colors of visited links
