// Button with triangle
//
// Originally seen at [Beats in Space](http://www.beatsinspace.net/)
//
// Experimental
// - it is strongly coupled with the `text-style`
// - it's not cross browser compatible. Sometimes between the text and triangle there is a smooth border which is ugly
// - if the text goes multi-line we will (almost) get a tooltip isntead of a button
